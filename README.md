## Fruit World
This application was created to solve a problem at Fortune Enterprises Ltd where
the director was required to go around to every Fruit World shop weekly to check
the stock they required. A problem presented itself when the director had to
write what each shop needed on a printed compact spreadsheet and from this mistakes
often occurred from the point of recording to loading up the delivery van or
hand writing packing slips that go with deliveries.

I solve this issue through recording data through a mobile web app and
automating the processes that follow in an attempt to minimize mistakes.

## Packing Slips
This application was created for the purpose of creating professional looking
packing slips for the company, Fortune Enterprises. It allows the user to focus
on what the customer needs instead of needing to remember how the item is packaged
reducing mistakes and improving the companies overall professional image.

This application has since been updated to support invoice slips, another critical
part of the workflow of orders processed at Fortune Enterprises and will now
allow all orders processed through Fortune Enterprises to no longer require
hand written slips.

### Frameworks
