# Fortune Enterprises app
## About
This project serves as a suite of applications created for Fortune Enterprises Ltd
to streamline the various tasks across the company and attempts to reduce as much
human error as possible while keeping the company workflow as quick and efficient
as possible.

## Creation
Creation page is for adding new users, customers and items to the database

## Fruit World
This application was created to solve a problem at Fortune Enterprises Ltd where
the director was required to go around to every Fruit World shop weekly to check
the stock they required. A problem presented itself when the director had to
hand write the items each shop needed on a printed compact spreadsheet and
from this mistakes often occurred from the point of recording to loading up the
delivery van or hand writing packing slips that go with deliveries.

I solve this issue through recording data through a mobile web app and
automating the processes that follow in an attempt to minimize mistakes.

## Packing Slips
This application was created for the purpose of creating professional looking
packing slips for the company, Fortune Enterprises Ltd. It allows the user to focus
on what the customer needs instead of needing to remember how the item is packaged
reducing mistakes and improving the companies overall professional image.

This application supports invoice slips, another critical
part of the workflow of orders processed at Fortune Enterprises and will now
allow all orders processed through Fortune Enterprises to no longer require
hand written slips.

### Frameworks
This project was created using Google's MVC AngularJS and Firebase
